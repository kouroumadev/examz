            <h1 className="py-5 text-lg font-bold">SECURITY</h1>
            <p>We shall try to take all precautions to protect the Personal Information both online and offline. We
                will try to protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce
                the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. We have standard SSL
                certification which basically helps us create a secure connection between our server and user to
                render any information or action. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption,
                physical access controls to our data centers and information access authorization controls. Only
                user passwords are encrypted in 64-bit encryption and stored because generally users use the same
                password on multiple sites, to prevent any kind of theft, piracy, or unauthorized access.
            </p>
            <p>We do not sell, transfer, or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing

                lost or used or accessed unlawfully. Processing your Personal Information will be done only in
                an authorized manner and subject to a duty of confidentiality. We also have procedures in place to
                deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you about any applicable regulator of a
